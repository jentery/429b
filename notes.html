<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>Below are some notes from lecture and class discussion.</p>

<h2 id="4January">4 January 2016</h2>
<p>Welcome to 429B, everyone. When you have a moment, please review the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/429bs2016.pdf">syllabus</a> and let me know of any concerns. We should also introduce ourselves: if you don't mind, then take a moment to chat with someone next to you. After you have a minute or so to talk, I'll ask you to introduce that person to the class by telling us their name, preferred pronoun, and the first thing that comes to their mind when they hear, "science fiction."</p>
<p>After introductions, let's start the semester with a few questions: Echoing our introductions, what does come to mind when we hear someone say, &quot;science fiction,&quot;? How about &quot;literature&quot;? Or &quot;speculation&quot;? What assumptions are at work when we define these terms, and to what effects on how we interpret fiction?</p>
<p>Throughout the term, we'll push on the intersections of science fiction, literature, and speculation, with an emphasis on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How speculation operates as a literary device corresponding with its historical moment,</li>
<li>How and why we might consider science fiction fundamental (i.e., canonical) to U.S. literature from the 1940s through the 1970s,</li>
<li>How speculation is expressed and operates through text, and</li>
<li>How speculation also melds politics with aesthetics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I'll draw a bit from Fredric Jameson's <em>Archaeologies of the Future</em>. A common debate is how science fiction differs from fantasy. Borrowing from Jameson, we might say that science fiction is &quot;the exploration of all constraints thrown up by history itself&quot; (2005: 66), wheras fantasy is &quot;a celebration of human creative power and freedom which becomes idealistic only by virtue of the omission of precisely those material and historical constraints&quot; (2005: 66). Later in the semester, we'll see these two converge, especially in the work of Ursula K. Le Guin. And, with writers such as Octavia E. Butler, Ishmael Reed, and Samuel R. Delany, we'll see forms of speculation that are steeped in history.</p>
<p>Since this course is tied to a particular historical period (1940s-1970s in the U.S.), we might also wish to start with what Jameson calls the &quot;various stages&quot; of science fiction. He lists them on page 93 of <em>Archaeologies</em>, and I'll paraphrase them here, with the understanding that they necessarily overlap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adventure or &quot;space opera&quot; between the 1870s and 1920s, typically associated with the work of <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/191620000LeaguesUnderTheSea">Jules Verne</a> and Edgar Rice Burroughs,</li>
<li>The mimesis of science, starting in the 1920s with pulp fiction such as Hugo Gernsback's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-oYbjDK3Z8"><em>Amazing Stories</em></a>,</li>
<li>Cultural critique and social satire during the 1940s and 50s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._Moore">C.L. Moore</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/KurtVonnegut-InConversationcompleteInterview">Kurt Vonnegut</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/CBSRadioWorkshop#"><em>The Space Merchants</em></a>, by Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth; and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>,</li>
<li>New subjectivities in the 1960s and '70s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Was_Plugged_In">Alice B. Sheldon/James Tiptree, Jr.</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Rare_Philip_K_Dick_interview_2006">Philip K. Dick</a>,</li>
<li>Speculative fiction and new aesthetics, especially during the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Interview_with_Octavia_Butler">Octavia Butler</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/PnUnscripted-IshmaelReed">Ishmael Reed</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/SeeingEarTheatre_690">Samuel R. Delany</a>, and</li>
<li>Cyberpunk during the 1980s and '90s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Timothy_Leary_Archives_206.dv">William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, we'll focus largely on 3, 4, and 5, including how they respond to 1 and 2 but also how they anticipate (or even serve as a critique of) 6. Our emphasis will be on how, when new worlds are imagined, we see material conditions, social relations, and modes of perception and knowing change, too (if at all). That is, <em>science fiction has a long history of creating worlds without changing worldviews</em>, and it is often quite socially and stylistically conservative. <em>How, then, are the books we're reading both challenging and perptuating norms, including norms we associate with writing, reading, communication, power, bodies, and landscapes?</em> How do they propose gaps between the histories or futures we may take for granted and the histories or futures that are possible or desirable? How, if ever, is science fiction an expression of radical imagination, and how does it correspond with the times in which it was written (even if it is not set in those times)?</p>
<p>For our next meeting (Monday the 11th), we'll start this discussion with C.L. Moore's &quot;No Woman Born,&quot; which you should read in its entirety. Please note we do not have class on Thursday the 7th.</p>
