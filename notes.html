<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>Below are some notes from lecture and class discussion.</p>

<h2><a id="14January"></a>14-21 January: <em>Babel-17</em></h2>

<p>Samuel R. Delany published <em>Babel-17</em> in 1966. Shortly thereafter, it received a Nebula Award for Best Novel. As a novel of the 1960s, we might understand it as a space opera of sorts.</p>

<h3>Space Opera</h3>

<p>Building on work by Hardesty (1980) and Malmgren (1993), space opera may be defined as: 
<ul>
<li>An art of drama, not of fiction (e.g., it aims to thrill and provoke fear, suspense, or sympathy, not necessarily experiment with language as a medium),</li>
<li>A genre following the conventions of adventure novels and westerns (e.g., think John Wayne here),</li>
<li>A recontextualization of those adventure novels and westerns, setting them in space or other worlds,</li>
<li>A rather conversative or predictable approach to narrative (e.g., we tend to know what's coming next), and</li>
<li>A tradition steeped in pulp fiction, including the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs.</li>
</ul>

<p>From your perspective, how does <em>Babel-17</em> read like a space opera? How is it conventional science fiction, or how does it compare to something such as <em>Star Wars</em>? What moments are predictable or even normative? Here, we might consider the plot devices; how characters such as Rydra, Brass, the Butcher, Slug, and TW-55 are depicted and embodied; how the worlds and landscapes (e.g., the Discorporate Sector) are described; how travel happens (e.g., Customs, Transport, and the <em>Rimbaud</em>); how conflicts and resolutions are written (e.g., Alliance and Invader); and who performs which role in the narrative (e.g., the dynamics between Rydra and Mocky).</p>

<p>We might also ask how Delany complicates space opera as a genre. While in many ways the novel reads quickly, with an investment in the art of drama, it is not a quintessential space opera, either. In particular, we might consider matters of representation (e.g., what roles are represented by whom, and to what effects on power relations in the narrative) and how Delany uses Babel-17 as a mechnanism for conflict&mdash;or as a weapon&mdash;in the novel.</p>

<p>In short, <em>Babel-17</em> both is and is not a space opera. In this sense, it's working from within a genre to change people's perception of that genre, or to at least speculate about generic conventions (e.g., what if space opera is about searching for a new language? what if the protagonist is not a white man?). One effect of these speculations is that the novel is saturated with thought experiments about what society could or should be.</p>

<h3>Whorfianism</h3>

<em>Babel-17</em> can also be read as an exercise in Whorfianism (the Sapir-Whorf sociolinguistic theory), or the position that language constitutes reality instead of reflecting or describing it. Following Malmgren (1993), the Whorfianism of <em>Babel-17</em> would include: 
<ul>
<li>The assumption that if you don't have the words, then you don't have the ideas (including the novel's interest in "I," "me," "my," and "myself"; see the Butcher and Rydra here),</li>
<li>Entertaining the possibility that there's a language everyone can speak (consider the epigraphs here; also consider the dynamics between Calli, Ron, and Mollya),</li>
<li>The belief that language physically alters the mind and body (consider Rydra's interpretations of micro-behaviours and impulses), </li>
<li>The claim that language produces selfhood and community (it doesn't just represent them), and </li>
<li>Considering when Babel-17 is a code and when it is a language.</li></ul>

<p>In the novel, how should we distinguish between Babel-17 as code and Babel-17 as a language? For instance, why does it matter that Rydra's a poet? Why does it matter that Markus T'mwarba is a psychoanalyst? Or what is the significance of not having a language where you can say "I"? As we respond to these questions, we might note how the following words serve a role in defining "language" and "code": mastery, program, novel, poem, universal, ambiguity, irony, play, memory, economy, certainty, subjective, objective, hidden, covert, decipher, human, machine, connection, alienation, autonomy, and behaviour (including non-verbal or embodied speech).</p>

<h3>Double Consciousness</h3>

Building on the work of Weedman (1982), Rutledge (2000), and Lavender (2007), <em>Babel-17</em> may be interpreted as an engagement with W.E.B. Du Bois's notion of "double consciousness"&mdash;or, according to Du Bois, a "two-ness," a "sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity" (see <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/dubois/ch01.html" target="_blank">Du Bois 1903</a>). Importantly, Du Bois was writing about slavery and racism in the United States, and he was writing as a person of colour. If, as Weedman, Rutledge, and Lavender have done, we read <em>Babel-17</em> with Du Bois's double consciousness in mind, then we should consider how Babel-17: 
<ul>
  <li>Lacks any reference to the self and thus any articulation of self-identity,</li>
  <li>Functions as a weapon, including a weapon of sabotage,</li>
  <li>Erases individual memories and extracts people from their history and culture,</li>
  <li>Produces sameness over difference (or two-ness),</li>
  <li>Programs people's behaviours or is a mechanism for thought control, and</li>
  <li>Prompts us to consider the colour lines of the book (e.g., where spaces are marked or racialized).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given her knowledge of languages and technologies, perhaps Rydra is able to "hack" or expand Babel-17. Perhaps she is able to make it more than mere code?</p>

<p>When asking these questions, it helps to understand <em>Babel-17</em> in the context of Afrofuturism. In his essay "Ethnoscapes," Lavender writes: "The blunt thesis underlying Afrofuturism is that <em>all</em> black cultural production in the New World <em>is</em> sf. . . . [W]hile Afrofuturism is helpful in illuminating the ways that sf typically and unthinkingly reproduces white privilege in its representations of technology and social interactions, it is specifically about the experience of the African diaspora" (2007: 188). That said, perhaps <em>Babel-17</em> is inspired by Afrofuturism without necessarily being Afrofuturist. While it is not explicity about the experience of the African diaspora, it does illuminate the default whiteness of science fiction and other genres of fiction from the mid-20th-century. Through Rydra, it also demonstrates how the use of language as a code to program sameness&mdash;or to erase memory, or to promote sabotage, or to turn bodies into machines&mdash;can be critiqued through a unique combination of Whorfianism and double consciousness (a combination that involves learning languages, telepathy, and old + new technologies).</p>

<p>Ultimately, what is your impression of this combination? What do you make of Rydra as a character? How much agency does she have? How much agency does language have? And what, by the way, do we make of her fear of the telepathic image of a worm? As we ask these questions, I think it's also important to keep in mind how <em>Babel-17</em> entangles words with worlds. For Rydra, it's imperative to speak multiple languages, perform various identities, and account for a "two-ness." Yet it is also important to produce new worlds through (the combination of) languages. Rydra cuts through worlds to join them&mdash;to make them both bigger (Delany 205).</p>

<h2><a id="11January"></a>11 January: "No Woman Born"</h2>

<p>C.L. Moore's "No Woman Born" was published in <em>Astounding Stories</em> in 1944, just prior to end of World War II. At this time, a key cultural question (or anxiety), often engaged in literature of the period, is whether technology was conducive to human autonomy. It is no coincidence, then, that Moore draws explicitly from Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em></p>

<p>Following last week's meeting, we might ask how "No Woman Born" is a speculative text. Which "what if?" questions does it ask? And to what effects on how we interpret Moore's writing?</p>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, I propose we use the following question as a way to interpret "No Woman Born": "What if gender is a performance?" Before we consider the implications of this question, we should note that the story has three primary characters: Deirdre (a famous actress and singer who dies, or loses her first body, in a theatre fire), Maltzer (who designs Deirdre's new metallic body, which houses her brain), and Harris (Deirdre's agent). We might note, too, that Deirdre is variously described, or describes herself variously, in the text. She is human, superhuman, nonhuman, robot, woman, female, and without sex, for instance. A question related to the performance of gender, then, is how much agency Deirdre has and when. If gender is a performance in the story, then when is Deidre trapped or objectified? When is she liberated? How does she relate to others, and how is she perceived? What power does she have?</p>

<p>Following existing research on Moore's work (see Hollinger 1999 and Stevenson 2007, e.g.), if gender is a performance in "No Woman Born," then we might suggest that:
<ul>
<li>Deirdre's identity (as a woman, as a performer) is linked to her body; generally speaking, to be a woman in "No Woman Born" is to look like a woman (or, more precisely, an idealized version of a woman).</li>
<li>To be a woman is to be an object of male desire; for instance, Maltzer frequently objectifies Deirdre as a thing he has made (a sort of "male birth fantasy").</li>
<li>Femininity and gender act as masks, with Deirdre mentally projecting her self-image onto her metallic body, which is frequently described as attractive (again, as an idealized version of a woman) even if it is "artificial" or "inorganic."</li>
<li>Deirdre may be described as sexless or not female, and these descriptions follow a binary logic (woman-man, human-nonhuman).</li>
<li>Deirdre may assert independence or autonomy from Maltzer (in particular) or patriarchal society (in general), in part through declarations that she owns herself, her brain, and/or her body.</li>
<li>Audiences, including Maltzer and Harris, routinely expect Deirdre to perform some sort of authenticity (e.g., to be a "real" woman or an "actual" human) through acts such as laughter and singing.</li>
<li>Deirdre, as the only humanoid, is simultaneously liberated by a degree of autonomy and isolated due to a lack of community or companionship; in her unique subject position, she is concerned about being alone.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>These interpretations do not cohere; however, one compelling (or literary) aspect of Moore's "No Woman Born" is how it approaches gender, technology, and culture with significant ambivalence.</p>

<h2><a id="4January"></a>4 January: Introductions</h2>
<p>Welcome to 429B, everyone. When you have a moment, please review the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/429bs2016.pdf">syllabus</a> and let me know of any concerns. We should also introduce ourselves: if you don't mind, then take a moment to chat with someone next to you. After you have a minute or so to talk, I'll ask you to introduce that person to the class by telling us their name, preferred pronoun, and the first thing that comes to their mind when they hear, "science fiction."</p>
<p>After introductions, let's start the semester with a few questions: Echoing our introductions, what does come to mind when we hear someone say, &quot;science fiction&quot;? How about &quot;literature&quot;? Or &quot;speculation&quot;? What assumptions are at work when we define these terms, and to what effects on how we interpret fiction?</p>
<p>Throughout the term, we'll push on the intersections of science fiction, literature, and speculation, with an emphasis on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How speculation operates as a literary device corresponding with its historical moment,</li>
<li>How and why we might consider science fiction fundamental (i.e., canonical) to U.S. literature from the 1940s through the 1970s,</li>
<li>How speculation is expressed and operates through text (when compared with film, e.g.), and</li>
<li>How speculation also melds politics with aesthetics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I'll draw a bit from Fredric Jameson's <em>Archaeologies of the Future</em>. A common debate is how science fiction differs from fantasy. Borrowing from Jameson, we might say that science fiction is &quot;the exploration of all constraints thrown up by history itself&quot; (2005: 66), wheras fantasy is &quot;a celebration of human creative power and freedom which becomes idealistic only by virtue of the omission of precisely those material and historical constraints&quot; (2005: 66). Later in the semester, we'll see these two converge, especially in the work of Ursula K. Le Guin. And, with writers such as Octavia E. Butler, Ishmael Reed, and Samuel R. Delany, we'll see forms of speculation that are steeped in history.</p>
<p>Since this course is tied to a particular historical period (1940s-1970s in the U.S.), we might also wish to start with what Jameson calls the &quot;various stages&quot; of science fiction. He lists them on page 93 of <em>Archaeologies</em>, and I'll paraphrase them here, with the understanding that they necessarily overlap and intermingle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adventure or &quot;space opera&quot; between the 1870s and 1920s, typically associated with the work of <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/191620000LeaguesUnderTheSea">Jules Verne</a> and Edgar Rice Burroughs,</li>
<li>The mimesis of science, starting in the 1920s with pulp fiction such as Hugo Gernsback's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-oYbjDK3Z8"><em>Amazing Stories</em></a>,</li>
<li>Cultural critique and social satire during the 1940s and 50s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._Moore">C.L. Moore</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/KurtVonnegut-InConversationcompleteInterview">Kurt Vonnegut</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/CBSRadioWorkshop#"><em>The Space Merchants</em></a>, by Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth; and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>,</li>
<li>New subjectivities in the 1960s and '70s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Was_Plugged_In">Alice B. Sheldon/James Tiptree, Jr.</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Rare_Philip_K_Dick_interview_2006">Philip K. Dick</a>,</li>
<li>Speculative fiction and new aesthetics, especially during the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Interview_with_Octavia_Butler">Octavia Butler</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/PnUnscripted-IshmaelReed">Ishmael Reed</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/SeeingEarTheatre_690">Samuel R. Delany</a>, and</li>
<li>Cyberpunk during the 1980s and '90s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Timothy_Leary_Archives_206.dv">William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, we'll focus largely on cultural critique, subjectivities, and speculative fiction, including how they respond to space opera and science but also how they anticipate (or even serve as a critique of) cyberpunk. Our emphasis will be on how, when new worlds are imagined, we see material conditions, social relations, and modes of perception and knowing change, too (if at all). That is, <em>science fiction has a long history of creating worlds without changing worldviews</em>, and it is often socially and stylistically conservative. <em>How, then, are the books we're reading both challenging and perptuating norms, including norms we associate with writing, reading, communication, power, bodies, and landscapes?</em> How do they propose gaps between the histories or futures we may take for granted and the histories or futures that are possible or desirable? How, if ever, is science fiction a literary expression of radical imagination, and how does it correspond with the times in which it was written (even if it is not set in those times)?</p>
<p>For our next meeting (Monday the 11th), we'll start this discussion with C.L. Moore's &quot;No Woman Born,&quot; which you should read in its entirety. Please note we do not have class on Thursday the 7th.</p>
