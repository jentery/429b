<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>Below are some notes from lecture and class discussion.</p>

<h2><a id="22February"></a>22 February - 3 March: <em>Kindred</em></h2>

<p>Published in 1979, <em>Kindred</em> is informed by new social history, black consciousness, and black feminism after the 1950s. Building on work by Eileen Donaldson, Madhu Dubey, Linh U. Hua, and Alys Eve Weinbaum, we might consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During the mid-1900s, slave testimonies increasingly became the focus of historical study and were treated as evidence for historical and legal research. An issue here is who was appropriating these testimonies and how. For instance, we must ask how histories of slavery were being commodified, commercialized, and/or sanitized (e.g., by popular media) during the time, and to what degree blacks were involved in authoring, producing, and circulating historical materials about slavery (e.g., matters of representation and economy).</li>
  <li>In this context, <em>Kindred</em> may be read as a response to suggestions that slavery and its consequences were "resolved" during the mid-1900s (e.g., the Civil Rights movement), or that America was "post-racial" (i.e., race no longer existed or mattered). In the novel, the past is continuous with the present (or it haunts the present), and race formations (including Dana's social and genealogical relations to both Rufus and Alice, or to the Weylins and Greenwoods) are a key theme.</li>
  <li>Butler uses elements of science fiction (e.g., time travel) to articulate her narrative; however, neither science nor technology is foregrounded in the novel. That is, <em>Kindred</em> may not feel like science fiction even with its speculative elements (e.g., when Dana time-travels from post-civil-rights America on the west coast to antebellum America on the east coast).</li>
  <li>Additionally, time travel does not connote control or mastery in <em>Kindred</em>. Dana is frequently compared with Harriet Tubman (an abolitionist who rescued enslaved families via the Underground Railroad), but Dana's story is arguably devoid of rescue. She does not determine when she goes back in time (in fact, one question is who hails her&mdash;Rufus? Alice?). She does not master gadgets or steer some vessel, either. And it's arguable that she doesn't really change history or attempt to free anyone. Instead, she's prompted to confront her origins and determine whether/how she'll secure her lineage (by engineering or ensuring the birth of her ancestors) through personal survival as well as through struggles for sexual and reproductive power. Here, kinship is strength and vulnerability, and Dana's freedom in the present (1970s) is neatly tied to legacies of violence, patriarchy, white supremacy, and slavery.</li>
  <li>In response to the novel, critics frequently ask how Dana is a victim but also complicit with histories of chattel slavery. Dana's agency is always compromised, and she may be an unreliable or heavily biased narrator. Importantly, such responses must account for how Butler uses speculation to have her characters (including Dana and Kevin) experience historical moments of slavery instead of treating slavery as an abstraction or a remote historical event existing only in the past. In so doing, Butler writes an alternate history that suggests the present isn't inevitable. That is, she uses alternate history to question rather than justify the present and ostensible future. Doing so is not typical in most science fiction, where history is frequently normative and written for/by straight white male readers.</li>
  <li>Madhu Dubey asks an important question of <em>Kindred</em>: "How far can contemporary subjects embody or identify with slave experience given that their access to slavery is inevitably mediated by late twentieth-century notions of freedom, agency, and bodily integrity?"</li>
  <li>Other important questions include, How should we describe the relationship between Rufus and Dana, or what brings them together? How should we describe the relationship or companionship between Alice and Dana, or what brings them together? Who is rendered disposable, by whom, and under what assumptions? How do Dana and Kevin respond to and experience antebellum Maryland? What experiences do they share, and when and why does Kevin have more agency? Ultimately, what changes for Dana? And finally, what are our sentimental attachments to time, or what are our investments in history, especially popular or normative history?</li>
</ul>
<p>Building on these observations and questions, it's important to note that <em>Kindred</em> has been described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A "neo-slave narrative," or a novel about the afterlife of slavery in the United States that obscures as much about chattel slavery as it reveals;</li>
<li>Grim fantasy (by Butler herself), or a novel that&mdash;without escaping the material conditions of history&mdash;uses alternate history to depict shadows of violence in the present (such shadows are perhaps symbolized by Dana's lost arm); 
<li>And also science fiction, speculative fiction, historical fiction, realist fiction, and an initiation story.</li>  
</ul>
<p>This array of descriptions reflects how significantly Butler experiments with genre, convention, and history in <em>Kindred</em>.</p>

<h2><a id="4February"></a> 4-18 February: <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em></h2>

<p>Published in 1969, <em>Left Hand</em> is probably the closest we'll come to a fantasy novel in 429B. It's part of Le Guin's Hainish cycle series (of short stories and novels), which she started in 1964, with <em>Left Hand</em> and <em>The Dispossessed</em> becoming the most notable works amongst the series' 20+ publications.</p>

<p>In all honesty, our "what if" question for <em>Left Hand</em> may be, "What if nothing happens?" Building on work by Mona Fayad, William Marcellino, Patrick O'Connor, and Fredric Jameson, consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the characters are skeptical of progress and linear time.</li>
<li>It is always Year One on Gethen (or Winter).</li>
<li>Gethenians tend to live in the present moment, often privileging not-knowing over contradiction, prediction, or certainty.</li>
<li>We might even argue that the characterization is flat or archetypal.</li>
<li>There is no revolution on Gethen. It's as if capitalism or industrialism never happened. Despite changes in technology and science, society and shifgrethor remain the same.</li>
<li>Instead of history there's mythology, or mythology is privileged over history.</li>
</ul>

<p>By extension (following Jameson, in particular), we might ask how Le Guin uses the technique of "world reduction" in her novel:</p>

<ul>
<li>Key conditions (e.g., profit, capitalism, seasons) of many readers' empirical realities are removed or excised from Gethen. That is, Le Guin's world is not familiar to readers (not "our world"), and this lack of familiarity is mostly achieved through reduction or excision. </li>
<li>Simplicity is a dominant paradigm on Gethen. It's often a topic, too, of many conversations (e.g., looking for answers to the wrong questions).</li>
<li>Le Guin critiques binaries frequently associated with patriarchy by rendering characters androgynous but also by affording characters ostensible freedom from sexual desire.</li>
<li>In some ways, such reductions represent utopian fantasies (e.g., absence of conflict).</li>
</ul>

<p>How should we respond to such reductions? How is Le Guin commenting on conflict, capitalism, or competition? Is her treatment of gender and sexuality essentialist? How do gender and sexuality manifest variously (or through contradictions) despite their reduction in the novel (e.g., pronouns, descriptions of character's bodies and behaviours, or Genly Ai's biases)?</p>

<p>As we ask these questions, we might also ask how Le Guin's novel responds to or interprets anthropology. (Many critics note that Le Guin's parents were anthropologists.) For instance (following Fayad, in particular):</p>
<ul>
<li>Genly is a visitor (or envoy). He's framed as an observer, and he frequently describes (or judges, really) Gethenian culture as "primitive." He struggles to be truly intimate with Gethenians, too.</li>
<li>Ultimately, Genly becomes a messenger, who is asked to (re)tell stories about "natives" (in general) and Estraven (in particular). </li>
<li>Still, Genly never really understands or identifies with the "Other" (Gethenian) in the novel, which is mostly about the biases of our visitor from another planet. Put this way, Gethenian androgyny (or gender ambiguity), together with its skepticism of progress and binaries, escapes Genly. He cannot "own" Gethenian culture. It is forever not his to own.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="25January"></a>25 January - 1 February: <em>Ubik</em></h2>

<p>Written and published around the same time as <em>Babel-17</em>, <em>Ubik</em> is one of Philip K. Dick's most critically acclaimed novels. As we read it, we might focus especially on the role of detritus, waste, or leftovers (e.g., "change") in the novel. That is, for science fiction, <em>Ubik</em> is very "material." It's not especially interested in treating the near future in abstract ways, and its aesthetic isn't overly invested in something like "the virtual" (where everything is made of information or ones and zeros). As you've probably noticed, it also borrows somewhat heavily from detective fiction and noir, as well as various religious texts, which are unmoored from their historical contexts.</p>

<p>Building on work by Fitting (1975), we might approach <em>Ubik</em> through two different, yet related, paradigms.</p>

<h3>The Representational Novel</h3>
<p>Here, <em>Ubik</em> critiques or experiments with the representational novel by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Troubling the assumption that text (on the page, in a book) is a mere vehicle for meaning, which pre-exists the novel at hand.</li>
  <li>Questioning the very notion of "real meaning" (e.g., through existentialist writing and philosophy).</li>
  <li>Experimenting with the novel as a form (e.g., the use of epigraphs), thereby highlighting the novel as a medium or process instead of relying on normative conventions readers would anticipate or want.</li>
  <li>Using exchange value as a key component of the novel (e.g., Ubik as the embodiment of a universal equivalent; it is that by which all things can be measured and valued; being ubiquitous, it replaces anything on the market) and thus prompting questions about what people expect from&mdash;or are willing to trade for&mdash;literature and culture.</li>
  <li>Using use value as a key component of the novel (e.g., Ubik produces need in characters such as Chip) and thus performing a countercultural critique of mass consumption and production in the second half of the 20th century.</li>
  <li>Treating the novel as a mirror instead of a window into reality and meaning (e.g., it nudges readers to reconsider what they think they know, or what they take for granted as true/fact).</li>
  <li>In a very "meta" sort of way, toying with the idea that the novel itself (i.e., <em>Ubik</em>) is a mechanism for control or manipulation (e.g., how the book often feels like an advertisement).</li>
  <li>Constantly returning to the "reality problem" (e.g., "is this real?" "am I hallucinating?" "did that happen?" "what year is it?" "where am I?").</li>
  <li>Building on a fear that there is no reality, while concluding with an open or ambiguous chapter that is neither pessimistic nor full of despair.</li>
  <li>Drawing attention to the ways in which exchange often dehumanizes people (e.g., the objectification of women, repeated requests for spare change, being shamed by objects capable of legal action, and paying as you go for essential services or needs). </li>
  <li>Using entropy and the linear regression of time (or chronological regression) as a plot device to demonstrate how exchanges are situated in time (e.g., the value of objects depends on when they are sold and used).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Anthropomorphism</h3>
<p>In this case, <em>Ubik</em> critiques or experiments with anthropomorphism by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Questioning the basic premise that the world (or nature) is made for humans, from a human perspective.</li>
  <li>Parodying scientific understandings or technical definitions of nature, by underscoring the rhetoric of science as well as how technical description frequently conceals ignorance.</li>
  <li>Begging the question of shared, empirical principles (e.g., by relying on private or subjective visions).</li>
  <li>Frequently addressing "taboo," repressed, or forbidden topics that underscore assumptions about how "human" or "normal" is defined in the first place.</li>
  <li>Presenting a science fiction premised on subjectivity (as opposed to "hard science").</li>
  <li>Intertwining religion with science, or spirituality with matter, or the supernatural with the empirical.</li>
  <li>Suggesting that reality is a mental construct.</li>
  <li>Embracing a position of not knowing as opposed to control, law, or dominion.</li>
  <li>Giving machines and everyday objects some agency.</li>
  <li>Underscoring a human desire to cheat or overcome death.</li>
  <li>Privileging decay over physical growth, thereby implying that people, technologies, and objects are not somehow outside of nature and physics.</li>
  <li>Delving into psychedelic alternatives to egocentrism and individuality, with some emphasis on collectivity (e.g., how people are connected in half-life).</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, we might combine these two paradigms to ask how <em>Ubik</em> engages the question of utopia. What does it mean for the impossible to be an object or aim of a novel? Of its characters? Can utopia be written? If it cannot, then how do novels such as <em>Ubik</em> help us imagine or approach it? To what effects on the aesthetics and subjectivities of speculative fiction?</p>

<h2><a id="14January"></a>14-21 January: <em>Babel-17</em></h2>

<p>Samuel R. Delany published <em>Babel-17</em> in 1966. Shortly thereafter, it received a Nebula Award for Best Novel. As a novel of the 1960s, we might understand it as a space opera of sorts.</p>

<h3>Space Opera</h3>

<p>Building on work by Hardesty (1980) and Malmgren (1993), space opera may be defined as: 
<ul>
<li>An art of drama, not of fiction (e.g., it aims to thrill and provoke fear, suspense, or sympathy, not necessarily experiment with language as a medium),</li>
<li>A genre following the conventions of adventure novels and westerns (e.g., think John Wayne here),</li>
<li>A recontextualization of those adventure novels and westerns, setting them in space or other worlds,</li>
<li>A rather conversative or predictable approach to narrative (e.g., we tend to know what's coming next), and</li>
<li>A tradition steeped in pulp fiction, including the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs.</li>
</ul>

<p>From your perspective, how does <em>Babel-17</em> read like a space opera? How is it conventional science fiction, or how does it compare to something such as <em>Star Wars</em>? What moments are predictable or even normative? Here, we might consider the plot devices; how characters such as Rydra, Brass, the Butcher, Slug, and TW-55 are depicted and embodied; how the worlds and landscapes (e.g., the Discorporate Sector) are described; how travel happens (e.g., Customs, Transport, and the <em>Rimbaud</em>); how conflicts and resolutions are written (e.g., Alliance and Invader); and who performs which role in the narrative (e.g., the dynamics between Rydra and Mocky).</p>

<p>We might also ask how Delany complicates space opera as a genre. While in many ways the novel reads quickly, with an investment in the art of drama, it is not a quintessential space opera, either. In particular, we might consider matters of representation (e.g., what roles are represented by whom, and to what effects on power relations in the narrative) and how Delany uses Babel-17 as a mechnanism for conflict&mdash;or as a weapon&mdash;in the novel.</p>

<p>In short, <em>Babel-17</em> both is and is not a space opera. In this sense, it's working from within a genre to change people's perception of that genre, or to at least speculate about generic conventions (e.g., what if space opera is about searching for a new language? what if the protagonist is not a white man?). One effect of these speculations is that the novel is saturated with thought experiments about what society could or should be.</p>

<h3>Whorfianism</h3>

<em>Babel-17</em> can also be read as an exercise in Whorfianism (the Sapir-Whorf sociolinguistic theory), or the position that language constitutes reality instead of reflecting or describing it. Following Malmgren (1993), the Whorfianism of <em>Babel-17</em> would include: 
<ul>
<li>The assumption that if you don't have the words, then you don't have the ideas (including the novel's interest in "I," "me," "my," and "myself"; see the Butcher and Rydra here),</li>
<li>Entertaining the possibility that there's a language everyone can speak (consider the epigraphs here; also consider the dynamics between Calli, Ron, and Mollya),</li>
<li>The belief that language physically alters the mind and body (consider Rydra's interpretations of micro-behaviours and impulses), </li>
<li>The claim that language produces selfhood and community (it doesn't just represent them), and </li>
<li>Considering when Babel-17 is a code and when it is a language.</li></ul>

<p>In the novel, how should we distinguish between Babel-17 as code and Babel-17 as a language? For instance, why does it matter that Rydra's a poet? Why does it matter that Markus T'mwarba is a psychoanalyst? Or what is the significance of not having a language where you can say "I"? As we respond to these questions, we might note how the following words serve a role in defining "language" and "code": mastery, program, novel, poem, universal, ambiguity, irony, play, memory, economy, certainty, subjective, objective, hidden, covert, decipher, human, machine, connection, alienation, autonomy, and behaviour (including non-verbal or embodied speech).</p>

<h3>Double Consciousness</h3>

Building on the work of Weedman (1982), Rutledge (2000), and Lavender (2007), <em>Babel-17</em> may be interpreted as an engagement with W.E.B. Du Bois's notion of "double consciousness"&mdash;or, according to Du Bois, a "two-ness," a "sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity" (see <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/dubois/ch01.html" target="_blank">Du Bois 1903</a>). Importantly, Du Bois was writing about slavery and racism in the United States, and he was writing as a person of colour. If, as Weedman, Rutledge, and Lavender have done, we read <em>Babel-17</em> with Du Bois's double consciousness in mind, then we should consider how Babel-17: 
<ul>
  <li>Lacks any reference to the self and thus any articulation of self-identity,</li>
  <li>Functions as a weapon, including a weapon of sabotage,</li>
  <li>Erases individual memories and extracts people from their history and culture,</li>
  <li>Produces sameness over difference (or two-ness),</li>
  <li>Programs people's behaviours or is a mechanism for thought control, and</li>
  <li>Prompts us to consider the colour lines of the book (e.g., where spaces are marked or racialized).</li>
</ul>
<p>Given her knowledge of languages and technologies, perhaps Rydra is able to "hack" or expand Babel-17. Perhaps she is able to make it more than mere code?</p>

<p>When asking these questions, it helps to understand <em>Babel-17</em> in the context of Afrofuturism. In his essay "Ethnoscapes," Lavender writes: "The blunt thesis underlying Afrofuturism is that <em>all</em> black cultural production in the New World <em>is</em> sf. . . . [W]hile Afrofuturism is helpful in illuminating the ways that sf typically and unthinkingly reproduces white privilege in its representations of technology and social interactions, it is specifically about the experience of the African diaspora" (2007: 188). That said, perhaps <em>Babel-17</em> is inspired by Afrofuturism without necessarily being Afrofuturist. While it is not explicity about the experience of the African diaspora, it does illuminate the default whiteness of science fiction and other genres of fiction from the mid-20th-century. Through Rydra, it also demonstrates how the use of language as a code to program sameness&mdash;or to erase memory, or to promote sabotage, or to turn bodies into machines&mdash;can be critiqued through a unique combination of Whorfianism and double consciousness (a combination that involves learning languages, telepathy, and old + new technologies).</p>

<p>Ultimately, what is your impression of this combination? What do you make of Rydra as a character? How much agency does she have? How much agency does language have? And what, by the way, do we make of her fear of the telepathic image of a worm? As we ask these questions, I think it's also important to keep in mind how <em>Babel-17</em> entangles words with worlds. For Rydra, it's imperative to speak multiple languages, perform various identities, and account for a "two-ness." Yet it is also important to produce new worlds through (the combination of) languages. Rydra cuts through worlds to join them&mdash;to make them both bigger (Delany 205).</p>

<h2><a id="11January"></a>11 January: "No Woman Born"</h2>

<p>C.L. Moore's "No Woman Born" was published in <em>Astounding Stories</em> in 1944, just prior to end of World War II. At this time, a key cultural question (or anxiety), often engaged in literature of the period, is whether technology was conducive to human autonomy. It is no coincidence, then, that Moore draws explicitly from Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em>.</p>

<p>Following last week's meeting, we might ask how "No Woman Born" is a speculative text. Which "what if?" questions does it ask? And to what effects on how we interpret Moore's writing?</p>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, I propose we use the following question as a way to interpret "No Woman Born": "What if gender is a performance?" Before we consider the implications of this question, we should note that the story has three primary characters: Deirdre (a famous actress and singer who dies, or loses her first body, in a theatre fire), Maltzer (who designs Deirdre's new metallic body, which houses her brain), and Harris (Deirdre's agent). We might note, too, that Deirdre is variously described, or describes herself variously, in the text. She is human, superhuman, nonhuman, robot, woman, female, and without sex, for instance. A question related to the performance of gender, then, is how much agency Deirdre has and when. If gender is a performance in the story, then when is Deidre trapped or objectified? When is she liberated? How does she relate to others, and how is she perceived? What power does she have?</p>

<p>Following existing research on Moore's work (see Hollinger 1999 and Stevenson 2007, e.g.), if gender is a performance in "No Woman Born," then we might suggest that:
<ul>
<li>Deirdre's identity (as a woman, as a performer) is linked to her body; generally speaking, to be a woman in "No Woman Born" is to look like a woman (or, more precisely, an idealized version of a woman).</li>
<li>To be a woman is to be an object of male desire; for instance, Maltzer frequently objectifies Deirdre as a thing he has made (a sort of "male birth fantasy").</li>
<li>Femininity and gender act as masks, with Deirdre mentally projecting her self-image onto her metallic body, which is frequently described as attractive (again, as an idealized version of a woman) even if it is "artificial" or "inorganic."</li>
<li>Deirdre may be described as sexless or not female, and these descriptions follow a binary logic (woman-man, human-nonhuman).</li>
<li>Deirdre may assert independence or autonomy from Maltzer (in particular) or patriarchal society (in general), in part through declarations that she owns herself, her brain, and/or her body.</li>
<li>Audiences, including Maltzer and Harris, routinely expect Deirdre to perform some sort of authenticity (e.g., to be a "real" woman or an "actual" human) through acts such as laughter and singing.</li>
<li>Deirdre, as the only humanoid, is simultaneously liberated by a degree of autonomy and isolated due to a lack of community or companionship; in her unique subject position, she is concerned about being alone.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>These interpretations do not cohere; however, one compelling (or literary) aspect of Moore's "No Woman Born" is how it approaches gender, technology, and culture with significant ambivalence.</p>

<h2><a id="4January"></a>4 January: Introductions</h2>
<p>Welcome to 429B, everyone. When you have a moment, please review the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/429bs2016.pdf">syllabus</a> and let me know of any concerns. We should also introduce ourselves: if you don't mind, then take a moment to chat with someone next to you. After you have a minute or so to talk, I'll ask you to introduce that person to the class by telling us their name, preferred pronoun, and the first thing that comes to their mind when they hear, "science fiction."</p>
<p>After introductions, let's start the semester with a few questions: Echoing our introductions, what does come to mind when we hear someone say, &quot;science fiction&quot;? How about &quot;literature&quot;? Or &quot;speculation&quot;? What assumptions are at work when we define these terms, and to what effects on how we interpret fiction?</p>
<p>Throughout the term, we'll push on the intersections of science fiction, literature, and speculation, with an emphasis on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How speculation operates as a literary device corresponding with its historical moment,</li>
<li>How and why we might consider science fiction fundamental (i.e., canonical) to U.S. literature from the 1940s through the 1970s,</li>
<li>How speculation is expressed and operates through text (when compared with film, e.g.), and</li>
<li>How speculation also melds politics with aesthetics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I'll draw a bit from Fredric Jameson's <em>Archaeologies of the Future</em>. A common debate is how science fiction differs from fantasy. Borrowing from Jameson, we might say that science fiction is &quot;the exploration of all constraints thrown up by history itself&quot; (2005: 66), wheras fantasy is &quot;a celebration of human creative power and freedom which becomes idealistic only by virtue of the omission of precisely those material and historical constraints&quot; (2005: 66). Later in the semester, we'll see these two converge, especially in the work of Ursula K. Le Guin. And, with writers such as Octavia E. Butler, Ishmael Reed, and Samuel R. Delany, we'll see forms of speculation that are steeped in history.</p>
<p>Since this course is tied to a particular historical period (1940s-1970s in the U.S.), we might also wish to start with what Jameson calls the &quot;various stages&quot; of science fiction. He lists them on page 93 of <em>Archaeologies</em>, and I'll paraphrase them here, with the understanding that they necessarily overlap and intermingle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adventure or &quot;space opera&quot; between the 1870s and 1920s, typically associated with the work of <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/191620000LeaguesUnderTheSea">Jules Verne</a> and Edgar Rice Burroughs,</li>
<li>The mimesis of science, starting in the 1920s with pulp fiction such as Hugo Gernsback's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-oYbjDK3Z8"><em>Amazing Stories</em></a>,</li>
<li>Cultural critique and social satire during the 1940s and 50s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._Moore">C.L. Moore</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/KurtVonnegut-InConversationcompleteInterview">Kurt Vonnegut</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/CBSRadioWorkshop#"><em>The Space Merchants</em></a>, by Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth; and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>,</li>
<li>New subjectivities in the 1960s and '70s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Was_Plugged_In">Alice B. Sheldon/James Tiptree, Jr.</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Rare_Philip_K_Dick_interview_2006">Philip K. Dick</a>,</li>
<li>Speculative fiction and new aesthetics, especially during the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Interview_with_Octavia_Butler">Octavia Butler</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/PnUnscripted-IshmaelReed">Ishmael Reed</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/SeeingEarTheatre_690">Samuel R. Delany</a>, and</li>
<li>Cyberpunk during the 1980s and '90s, including <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/Timothy_Leary_Archives_206.dv">William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, we'll focus largely on cultural critique, subjectivities, and speculative fiction, including how they respond to space opera and science but also how they anticipate (or even serve as a critique of) cyberpunk. Our emphasis will be on how, when new worlds are imagined, we see material conditions, social relations, and modes of perception and knowing change, too (if at all). That is, <em>science fiction has a long history of creating worlds without changing worldviews</em>, and it is often socially and stylistically conservative. <em>How, then, are the books we're reading both challenging and perptuating norms, including norms we associate with writing, reading, communication, power, bodies, and landscapes?</em> How do they propose gaps between the histories or futures we may take for granted and the histories or futures that are possible or desirable? How, if ever, is science fiction a literary expression of radical imagination, and how does it correspond with the times in which it was written (even if it is not set in those times)?</p>
<p>For our next meeting (Monday the 11th), we'll start this discussion with C.L. Moore's &quot;No Woman Born,&quot; which you should read in its entirety. Please note we do not have class on Thursday the 7th.</p>
