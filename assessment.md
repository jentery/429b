# Assessment 

The English Department uses the following scale for grading purposes: A+ (90-100), A (85-89), A- (80-84), B+ (77-79), B	(73-76), B- (70-72), C+ (65-69), C	(60-64), D (50-59),	F	(0-49)

I do not use plagiarism detection software when assessing student work, and final grades will be determined in accordance with the University’s official grading system.

## N Grades

Students who submit the following will complete the course and will be assigned a final grade:  

* One short essay, and   
* The final exam.

Failure to complete these will result in an "N" regardless of the cumulative percentage on other assignments. An "N" is a failing grade, and it factors into your GPA as a 0 (the maximum percentage that can accompany an “N” on a transcript is 49).  

## Grading Rubric for Essays 

A+: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is incredibly focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is incredibly persuasive.  

A- through A: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is persuasive.  

B- through B+: The content meets expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates some awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects engagement with the selected text, and the argument is sound.  

C or C+: The content meets some expectations of the prompt. It is somewhat focused and integrates some examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates minimal awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers few perspectives. It reflects engagement with the selected text; however, the argument is not sound.  

D: The content does not meet expectations of the prompt. It is not focused, or it does not integrate examples with explanations or analysis. It does not demonstrate awareness of its own limitations or implications, or it does not consider multiple perspectives. It does not reflect engagement with the selected text, and the argument is not sound.  

F: The content is missing or falls extremely short of the word count.

(Aspects of this grading rubric were borrowed from a syllabus by Mark Sample.) 

## Grading Rubric for Presentations 

A+: The content and delivery exceed expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate a highly proficient, even memorable knowledge of the course material. They spark significant discussion.

A- through A: The content and delivery exceed expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate a proficient knowledge of the course material. They spark significant discussion.

B- through B+: The content and delivery meet expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate accepted knowledge of the course material. They spark some discussion.

C or C+: The content and delivery meet some expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate accepted knowledge of the course material but spark little to no discussion.

D: The content and delivery do not meet expectations of the prompt. They demonstrate some knowledge of the course material but do not spark discussion.

F: The presentation is not given, or the content and delivery do not meet expectations of the prompt. They do not demonstrate knowledge of the course material, and they do not spark discussion.

## How to Do Well in this Course 

*Read the books before we discuss them*. Otherwise, you will not be able to follow lectures or conversations in class. Plus, demonstrating you’ve read the book means you’ll likely do well on the final exam.  

*Write while you read*. For me this means annotating a text as I read it. You can annotate print and digital texts. (See me if you need ideas or resources.)

*Come to class with ideas and questions*. Be curious. Seek connections not only between texts, but also between this course and other courses you’re taking.  

*Take notes during class meetings*. A good portion of the final exam will cover what we talk about in class. Students who take good notes not only understand but also retain the material better. They also do better on the exam than students who do no not take notes. 

*Let me know when you don’t follow what I’m saying*. I am not aware of what you do not know or do not understand, and I may assume more contextual knowledge on your part than you have. I find this stuff fascinating, but I will not always know what you want to investigate or learn more about. If you have questions, then please don't hesitate to ask them. There's no need to feel like an imposter in this course.  

*Persuasive writing takes time*. Before you submit an essay or present during class, consider writing and circulating drafts. Ask friends or peers to give your writing a gander. Come chat with me during office hours. Consider how your writing can extend and even complicate our class discussions. Also, avoid writing that is primarily descriptive. Push your work into an analysis of the assumptions, aesthetics, and ambiguity at work in literature. 

*During class and in writing, be concrete when you comment on anyone's work* (including the novels we're discussing). Quote it. Speak to specific gestures. And then respond with your own interpretations. When the work is by a peer, be sure to affirm their ideas (e.g., “I like how you…”).

*Use class meetings to share ideas, but also discuss what we’re reading outside of class*. If you have a question, then ask me or your classmates. If you hear something you want to remember, then write it down for later reference. Consider forming reading and writing groups for the course.
