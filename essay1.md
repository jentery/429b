# Short Essay 1: Close Reading or Deconstruction (25% of your final mark) 

For your first essay in 429B, please write about one of the following: “No Woman Born,” *Babel-17*, or *Ubik*. The essay should consist of 1000-1500 words (excluding references) in MLA format, submitted to me in print with your name on it. For the essay, you have two choices: 
  * Close Reading: Please select a compelling passage in the text at hand and conduct a close reading of it. Focus your entire essay on this passage, offering context where necessary. Please do not compare the passage with other texts, and do not draw material from existing scholarship or historical documents. Ultimately, your close reading should: i) account for vocabulary, patterns, perspectives, and metaphors in the selected text; ii) underscore how an aspect of the text has more than one meaning; iii) articulate the consequence of these meanings coexisting in ambiguity; and iv) communicate why it is important for readers to know about this ambiguity (e.g., tell us how the passage you selected helps us understand the fiction at hand more completely). 
  * Deconstruction: Please select a compelling passage in the text at hand and deconstruct it. Focus your entire essay on this passage, offering context where necessary. Please do not compare the passage with other texts (primary or secondary sources), and do not draw material from existing scholarship or historical documents. Ultimately, your deconstruction should: i) account for something missing explicitly from, yet nevertheless present in, the text; ii) underscore how what’s missing informs an interpretation of the text; iii) articulate the consequence of that interpretation; and iv) communicate why it is important for readers to know why what’s missing matters (e.g., tell us how the absence you identified helps us understand the creation and reception of the fiction at hand).
