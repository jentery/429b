<a id="policies" class="anchor" href="#policies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Policies</h1>
<p>Below are the policies for this course.</p>
<h2>
<a id="attendance" class="anchor" href="#attendance" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attendance</h2>

<p>You are expected to attend all classes in which you are enrolled. A department may require a student to withdraw from a course if the student is registered in another course that conflicts with it in time. An instructor may refuse a student admission to a lecture because of lateness, misconduct, inattention, or failure to meet the responsibilities of the course. Students who neglect their academic work, including assignments, may be refused permission to write the final examination in a course. Students who are absent because of illness, an accident, or family affliction should report to me upon their return to classes.</p>

<p>Aside from attending for the sake of attending, I create several incentives for you to come to class. Those incentives include: 1) lectures and discussion related to your essays, presentations, and exam; 2) mentioning material that will be on the exam; 3) providing writing instruction and feedback; and 4) encouraging you to speak with others about the literature weâ€™re reading. </p>

<p>If you miss more than 20% of the scheduled class meetings (without documentation of illness, accident, or family affliction), then you may not qualify for the final exam.</p>

<h2>
<a id="circulation-of-marks" class="anchor" href="#circulation-of-marks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Circulation of Marks</h2>

<p>I will not, at any time, post your marks outside my office door, online, or in any other public forum. </p>

<h2>
<a id="participation" class="anchor" href="#participation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Participation</h2>

<p>Since conversations are essential to the quality of this class, we will work together to create an atmosphere premised on difference. University level discourse does not shy away from sensitive issues, including questions of race, gender, class, sexuality, politics, and religion, and neither will we. There are going to be differences in opinions, beliefs, and interpretations when we read literature, question it, and engage history and culture. You need not agree with the arguments presented during class or with what your peers or I have to say. In fact, it is important to think critically and question course material. But please do so intelligently, without the assumption that everyone agrees with you or shares your experiences. Difference is central to creating a classroom in which a variety of ideas can be exchanged and points of view can be explored. Ultimately, what is crucial to this course is that you are comfortable expressing yourself and your ideas. If, for whatever reason, you are not, then you should notify me immediately in class or visit me during my office hours. I understand that some people are more comfortable speaking in front of the class than others. That said, participation in office hours also augments learning. If you are not comfortable bringing your concerns directly to me or are not satisfied with my response to your inquiries, then I encourage you to contact the Department of English.</p>

<h2>
<a id="late-and-missed-submissions" class="anchor" href="#late-and-missed-submissions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Late and Missed Submissions</h2>

<p>If writing assignments are submitted after the due date, then I will not comment on them. Extension of a due date must be negotiated with me in advance, and medical or other emergency exceptions to this policy must be properly documented. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will not accept either of your presentations after the date they are scheduled. </p>

<h2>
<a id="mobile-technologies-in-the-classroom" class="anchor" href="#mobile-technologies-in-the-classroom" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile Technologies in the Classroom</h2>

<p>I do not ban laptops or other mobile technologies in the classroom. Feel free to use them for note-taking, in-class research, or other class-related activities.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="e-mail" class="anchor" href="#e-mail" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>E-Mail</h2>

<p>With the exception of holidays and weekends, I will respond to your emails within twenty-four hours.</p>

<h2>
<a id="learning-climate" class="anchor" href="#learning-climate" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning Climate</h2>

<p>The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the UVic human rights policy. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants.</p>

<h2>
<a id="academic-integrity" class="anchor" href="#academic-integrity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>Students are expected to adhere to the UVic academic integrity policy. Violations of this policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review.</p>

<h2>
<a id="writing-improvement" class="anchor" href="#writing-improvement" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Writing Improvement</h2>

<p>I may require you to seek general writing improvement and/or assignment tutoring at The Learning and Teaching Centre. If so, then I may also ask you to revise your work within three weeks of receiving notice from me. </p>

<h2>
<a id="accessibility" class="anchor" href="#accessibility" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accessibility</h2>

<p>Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, then please feel free to approach me and/or the Resource Centre for Students with a Disability (RCSD) as soon as possible. RCSD staff is available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the sooner we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.</p>
