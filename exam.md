# Final Exam (30% of your final mark) 

At the termâ€™s end, I will administer the final exam during the official exam period. It will cover all texts assigned during the term and will consist of short-answer and multiple-choice questions, together with quote identifications. It will not include essays, and it will not be open-book.
