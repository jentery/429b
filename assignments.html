<p>For your first essay in 429B, please write about one of the following: “No Woman Born,” <em>Babel-17</em>, or <em>Ubik</em>. The essay should consist of 1000-1500 words (excluding references) in MLA format, submitted to me in print with your name on it. For the essay, you have two choices: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Close Reading</strong>: Please select a compelling passage in the text at hand and conduct a close reading of it. Focus your entire essay on this passage, offering context where necessary. Please do not compare the passage with other texts, and do not draw material from existing scholarship or historical documents. Ultimately, your close reading should: i) account for vocabulary, patterns, perspectives, and metaphors in the selected text; ii) underscore how an aspect of the text has more than one meaning; iii) articulate the consequence of these meanings coexisting in ambiguity; and iv) communicate why it is important for readers to know about this ambiguity (e.g., tell us how the passage you selected helps us understand the fiction at hand more completely). </li>
<li>
<strong>Deconstruction</strong>: Please select a compelling passage in the text at hand and deconstruct it. Focus your entire essay on this passage, offering context where necessary. Please do not compare the passage with other texts (primary or secondary sources), and do not draw material from existing scholarship or historical documents. Ultimately, your deconstruction should: i) account for something missing explicitly from, yet nevertheless present in, the text; ii) underscore how what’s missing informs an interpretation of the text; iii) articulate the consequence of that interpretation; and iv) communicate why it is important for readers to know why what’s missing matters (e.g., tell us how the absence you identified helps us understand the creation and reception of the fiction at hand). </li>
</ul>

<p>For your second essay in 429B, please write about one of the following: <em>The Left Hand of Darkness,</em> <em>Kindred,</em> <em>Mumbo Jumbo,</em> or <em>Slaughterhouse Five.</em> The essay should consist of 1000-1500 words (excluding references) in MLA format, submitted to me in print with your name on it. For the essay, you have two choices: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Speculative Reading</strong>: Please select a compelling passage in the text at hand and conduct a speculative reading of it. Situate this passage in relation to the balance of the novel. Please do not compare the novel with other novels, and do not draw material from existing scholarship or historical documents. Ultimately, your speculative reading should ask “what if?” of your selected novel by: i) identifying a core metaphor at work in the passage; ii) creating and using a specific technique to systematically alter the passage and enhance, diminish, or ruin its metaphor; iii) interpreting the altered passage as if it is the original; iv) articulating the consequences of altering the passage, with attention to differences between the original and its alteration; and v) communicating the relevance of your speculative reading to others interested in the fiction at hand (e.g., tell us what your alteration says about the novel’s aesthetics or politics).<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reparative Reading</strong>: Please select a compelling passage in the text at hand and conduct a reparative reading of it. Situate this passage in relation to the balance of the novel. Please do not draw material from existing scholarship or historical documents. Ultimately, your reparative reading should address the capacities and pleasures of science fiction by: i) identifying a suggestive gesture or aesthetic at work in the passage; ii) amplifying that gesture or aesthetic by highlighting what it does persuasively; iii) interpreting the exceptional and everyday dimensions of the gesture or aesthetic; iv) articulating the consequences of your interpretation for science fiction at large; and v) communicating what the passage suggests about the transformative potential of science fiction (e.g., tell us how the novel prompts people to consider aesthetic or political change).<br>

</ul>

<p>Once during the term, you will present for three to four minutes about an assigned text. Conducted at the beginning of a class meeting, this presentation should prompt group discussion by: a) drawing us to a specific moment in the text at hand, b) contextualizing that moment within the plot of the assigned text, c) telling us why you think this moment is interesting, and d) giving us one question to consider as we proceed with discussion.  </p>

<p>During our last meeting, you will give a one-minute presentation about the most important thing you learned from the assigned texts and class discussions this term. These presentations should be not only well prepared but also precise in their composition.    </p>

<p>At the term’s end, I will administer the final exam during the official exam period. It will cover all texts assigned during the term and will consist of short-answer and multiple-choice questions, together with quote identifications. It will not include essays, and it will not be open-book.</p>
