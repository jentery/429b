# Required Texts for English 429B (Spring 2016) 

* *Kindred*, Octavia E. Butler
* *Babel-17*, Samuel R. Delany 
* *Ubik*, Philip K. Dick			
* *The Left Hand of Darkness*, Ursula K. Le Guin 
* “No Woman Born,” C.L. Moore	
* *Mumbo Jumbo*, Ishmael Reed 
* *Slaughterhouse Five*, Kurt Vonnegut

With the exception of “No Woman Born” (which will be circulated to you during class), required texts are available (in used condition) at the UVic Bookstore, for a total of $100-120. I will reference the Bookstore’s copies during class discussion, but feel free to choose whichever edition you prefer, in print or digital format. (I recommend reading these books in print.) If we are pressed for time this semester, then we will cut *Slaughterhouse Five* from the reading schedule.
