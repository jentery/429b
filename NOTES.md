# Lecture and Discussion Notes 

## 4 January 2016 

Welcome to 429B, everyone. When you have a moment, please review the [syllabus](http://web.uvic.ca/~englblog/429bs2016.pdf) and let me know of any concerns.  

Let's start the semester with a few questions: When we hear someone say, "science fiction," what comes to mind? How about "literature"? And "speculation"? What assumptions are at work here, and to what effects on how we define or describe each? 

During the term, we'll push on the intersections of these three terms, with an emphasis on:

1. How speculation operates as a literary device corresponding with its historical moment, 
2. How and why we might consider science fiction fundamental to U.S. literature from the 1940s through the 1970s, and
3. How speculation melds politics with aesthetics.  

To begin, I'll draw a bit from Fredric Jameson's *Archaeologies of the Future*. A common question is how science fiction differs from fantasy. Borrowing from Jameson, we might say that science fiction is "the exploration of all constraints thrown up by history itself" (2005: 66), wheras fantasy is "a celebration of human creative power and freedom which becomes idealistic only by virtue of the omission of precisely those material and historical constraints" (2005: 66). Later in the semester, we'll see these two converge, especially in the work of Ursula K. Le Guin. And with writers such as Octavia E. Butler and Samuel R. Delany, we'll see forms of speculation that are steeped in history. 
 
Since this course is tied to a particular historical period (1940s-1970s in the U.S.), we might also wish to consider what Jameson calls the "various stages" of science fiction. He lists them on page 93 of *Archaeologies*, and I'll paraphrase them here: 

1. Adventure or "space opera" between the 1870s and 1920s, typically associated with the work of [Jules Verne](https://archive.org/details/191620000LeaguesUnderTheSea) and Edgar Rice Burroughs, 
2. The mimesis of science, starting in the 1920s with pulp fiction such as Hugo Gernsback's [*Amazing Stories*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-oYbjDK3Z8),
3. Cultural critique and social satire during the 1940s and 50s, including [*The Space Merchants*](https://archive.org/details/CBSRadioWorkshop#), by Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth, as well as *The Twilight Zone*, 
4. New subjectivities in the 1960s, including [Philip K. Dick's work](https://archive.org/details/Rare_Philip_K_Dick_interview_2006)'s work, which we'll read this term, 
5. Speculative fiction and new aesthetics, especially during the 1960s, '70s, and '80s, including [Samuel R. Delany's work](https://archive.org/details/SeeingEarTheatre_690), which we'll also read this term, and 
6. Cyberpunk during the 1980s and '90s, including [William Gibson's *Neuromancer*](https://archive.org/details/Timothy_Leary_Archives_206.dv).

In this course, we'll focus largely on 3, 4, and 5, including how they respond to 1 but also how they anticipate 6. Our emphasis will be on how, when new worlds are imagined, we see material conditions, social realtions, and modes of perception and knowing change, too (if at all). How are the books we're reading both challenging and perptuating norms, including norms we associate with writing, reading, power, bodies, and landscapes? How do they propose gaps between the histories or futures we may take for granted and the histories or futures that are possible? 

For our next meeting (Monday the 11th), we'll start this discussion with C.L. Moore's "No Woman Born," which you should read in its entirety.
